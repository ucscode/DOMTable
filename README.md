# DOMTable

DOMTable is a lightweight PHP library that simplifies the process of creating tables with minimal code. It utilizes the Document Object Model (DOM) to generate HTML code, allowing you to easily display data in a table format. The library is designed to be simple, efficient, and requires no external dependencies.

## Features

- Create HTML tables from MySQL query results or arrays
- Customize table columns and their display titles
- Manipulate column values before displaying them in the table
- Option to print the table directly to the browser or obtain it as a string

## Installation

To use DOMTable in your PHP project, you can follow these steps:

1. Download the `DOMTable.php` repo as .zip file
2. Place the `DOMTable.php` file in your project directory.
3. Include the file in your PHP script using `require_once 'DOMTable.php';`.

## Usage

### Setting up a table

```php
// Instantiate DOMTable with table name
$table = new DOMTable("users");

// Set columns to display on the table
$table->columns(array(
    "id",
    "username",
    "email"
));

// Fetch data from MySQL database
$mysql_result = $db->query("SELECT * FROM users");

// Populate the table with data
$table->data($mysql_result);

// Generate the HTML code for the table
echo $table->prepare();
```

### Populating With Array

Data may also be populated with array. Consider the example below:

```php
$data = array(
    array(
        'id' => 1,
        'username' => 'John',
        'email' => 'john@example.com',
    ),
    array(
        'id' => 2,
        'username' => 'Jane',
        'email' => 'jane@example.com',
    ),
    // Add more rows as needed
);

$table->data($data);
```

In this example, the $data array contains multiple rows of data, where each row is represented as an associative array. Each key in the associative array corresponds to a column name, and the corresponding value represents the data for that column in the row. You can add as many rows as needed to populate the table with your desired data.

### Modifying column values

You can modify the values of the table columns before they are displayed using the `prepare()` method. The method accepts a callback function as an optional parameter, which allows you to manipulate the data.

```php
$table->prepare(function($data) {
    $data['username'] = 'updated username';
    $data['email'] = 'changed@email.com';
    return $data;
});
```

### Printing or obtaining the table

By default, the `prepare()` method will directly print the HTML table to the browser. However, you can also obtain the generated table as a string by passing `false` as the second parameter.

```php
$tableHTML = $table->prepare(null, false);
```
